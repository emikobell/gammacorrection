function UpdateStimulus(windowPointer, wPattern, hPattern, GreyLevel)

% Updates an already-present grey-matching pattern and disc figure, and draws a new grey-disc by calling DrawDisc.
% Please use with SetupIntialStimulus for optimal performance. If not, a figure window must be present as an object to call.
% When not using this function in a loop, please use the CloseandTidy function immediately after.
